# To-Do list

## Tumorigenesis

### Analytical

0. Get shit together for macrophages __(Deadline 06.11.2018)__
1. Identify genes for experimental part __(Deadline: 16.11.2018)__
    - Genes as markers for various populations for FACS, staining and qPCR
2. Fully label all subpopulations apart from T-Cells __(Deadline: 16.11.2018)__
   - prepare for the meetings and try to get as much as possible out of them
3. Work out structure in the T-Cell compartment __(Deadline: 31.11.2018)__
   - read notes from the talk 
   - ways to deal with continuous variation
4. Ligand-Receptor interactions __(frist progress by 31.11.2018)__
   - compile list of potential tools __(16.11.2018)__
5. Can you do something useful with the Macrophage doublets __(20.12.2018)__
   - look up the PIC-seq stuff
   - DE against macrophages with tumor cell singlets as null model?

### Experimental

0. Talk to Kyren about mice for validation experiment, tumors soon? __(Deadline: 06.11.2018)__
1. Final decision on MPA/DMBA mice __(Deadline: 16.11.2018)__
2. Ordering of qPCR primers for validation of tumor pseudotime __(Deadline: 9.11.2018)__
3. Ordering of antibodies for stainings __(Deadline: 20.11.2018)__
4. Catalogue of available slides __(Deadline: 20.11.2018)__

## Lineage Tracing paper

1. Comparison to normal alveologenesis 
   - integrate data __(Deadline: 10.11.2018)__
   - first comparions __(Deadline: 12.11.2018)__
2. Analyse MPA/DMBA data
