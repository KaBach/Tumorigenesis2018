# To-Do list

## Tumorigenesis

### Analytical

1. Identify genes for experimental part __(Deadline: 7.12.2018)__
    - Genes as markers for various populations for FACS, staining and qPCR
2. Fully label all subpopulations apart from T-Cells __(Deadline: 16.12.2018)__
3. Work out structure in the T-Cell compartment __(Deadline: 21.12.2018)__
   - read notes from the talk 
   - ways to deal with continuous variation
4. Ligand-Receptor interactions __(frist progress by 21.12.2018)__
   - compile list of potential tools __(16.12.2018)__
5. Can you do something useful with the Macrophage doublets __(20.12.2018)__
   - look up the PIC-seq stuff
   - DE against macrophages with tumor cell singlets as null model?

### Experimental

0. Talk to Kyren about mice for validation experiment, tumors soon? __(Deadline: 30.11.2018)__
1. Final decision on MPA/DMBA mice __(Deadline: 30.11.2018)__
2. Ordering of qPCR primers for validation of tumor pseudotime __(Deadline: 30.11.2018)__
3. Ordering of antibodies for stainings __(start by 06.12.2018)__
4. Catalogue of available slides __(Do on 07.12.2018)__

## Notes
# Immune cells
- progesterone can regulate the Th1/Th2 phenotype
- previous studies have suggested that E and P are capable of regulating macrophage distribution in the uterus [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4204476/pdf/nihms564062.pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4204476/pdf/nihms564062.pdf)
