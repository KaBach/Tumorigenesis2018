# To-Do list


## Computational

1. Systematic test for differential abundance (that seems to work okay, question is whether it's more sensible to do this per "group")
2. Systematic test for DE
 - Background correction works if I define early and late groups instead of using a cont covariate
 - low DE genes have inflated lFC

--- Things for short term ---
- M1/2 enrichment
- A bit on the Fibroblasts
- Ribbon plots


### Random Ideas and Notes
- Can you do something useful with the Macrophage doublets 
   - look up the PIC-seq stuff
   - DE against macrophages with tumor cell singlets as null model?
- Ccl8 in Mp2 increase has been implicated in promotion of mets but not early development
- TAMs being result from monocyte influx is fairly accepted, changes in RM not so much
